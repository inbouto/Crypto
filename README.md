# Crypto

This is a pet project of mine written in Kotlin. I was inspired to work on this from this youtube playlist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJquEYhiq_U&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61KHzhg3JIJdK08JLSlcLId. You might be able to find some useful ByteArray manipulation methods in there as well as a Lamport signature scheme.
For more details, check out this documentation file https://github.com/inbouto/Crypto/blob/master/doc/alltypes/index.md . 
Also you can download the documentation in html format here https://github.com/inbouto/Crypto/blob/master/doc/html.zip
