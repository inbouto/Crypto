# Crypto

This is a pet project of mine. You might be able to find some useful ByteArray manipulation methods in there as well as a Lamport signature scheme.
For more details, check out this documentation file https://github.com/inbouto/Crypto/blob/master/doc/alltypes/index.md . 
Also you can download the documentation in html format here https://github.com/inbouto/Crypto/blob/master/doc/html.zip
